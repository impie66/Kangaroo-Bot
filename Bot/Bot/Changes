Changelog
My internet was down for a couple days so i decided to get some shit done

Bot now nukes (Thanks to Yegers) `Yegers.canCount = true;`
Some general changes builds to suit my mood.

Score sensetive orders. Basically if a unit is retreating but can win a local engagement will finsh the engagement before retreating. 
A ton of code cleanup and some basic re-writes
Bot now sims all units nearby a chokepoint instead of each side's 'combat ready troops' (Basically units within a certain range to fight)
Bot now scans to find enemy if their location is unknown
Added Golaiths and Valkyris, queens, wraiths.
Adjusted the "Unknown" build to be more techy (for bots that random)
Updated to ASS 1.1
Updated to jBwapi 1.0
Bot now attempts to run away from it's own spidermines to avoid friendly fire. 
Bot now adds workers to the unit queue when expanding

Bot now does well against the Stock AI (Inbuilt AI) I'll be ready to upload soon. 

Current Issues:

The bot still sucks.
