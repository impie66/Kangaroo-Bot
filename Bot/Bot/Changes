Changelog
My internet was down for a couple days so i decided to get some shit done

Bot now nukes (Thanks to Yegers) `Yegers.canCount = true;`
Some general changes builds to suit my mood. 
Bot now builds defences at bases.
Score sensitive orders. Basically if a unit is retreating but can win a local engagement will finsh the engagement before retreating. 
A ton of code cleanup and some basic re-writes
Bot now sims all units nearby a chokepoint instead of each side's 'combat ready troops' (Basically units within a certain range to fight)
Bot now scans to find enemy if their location is unknown
Added Goliath and Valkyries, queens, wraiths.
Adjusted the "Unknown" build to be more techy (for bots that random)
Updated to ASS 1.1
Updated to jBwapi 1.0
Bot now attempts to run away from it's own spidermines to avoid friendly fire. 
Bot now adds workers to the unit queue when expanding
Fixed spellcasters for zerg (Bot Wasn't identifying them) (Someone who will remain anonymous forgot to add them to onUnitMorph event)
Bot now does well against the Stock AI (Inbuilt AI) I'll be ready to upload soon. 
Some bot regrouping decision making changes (Not trying to regroup when 90% of the units are simmed to win)
Fixed bot assigning the same worker to multiple bases (You can thank onFrame for that)
Added a bunch of meme builds for terran.



Current Issues:

The bot still sucks.
Bot will sometimes scout again when the enemy has already been scouted.
Squad lead units will attempt to regroup while running away.


And yes i know that's not spelt right eclipse you can fuck right off
And fuck you again for not recognising british english
